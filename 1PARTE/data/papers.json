    "abstract": "Context: Deep learning (DL) techniques have gained significant popularity among software engineering (SE) researchers in recent years. This is because they can often solve many SE challenges without enormous manual feature effort and complex domain knowledge. Objective: Although DL studies reported substantial advantages over other state-of-the-art models on effectiveness, ignore two factors: (1) reproducibility —whether the experimental results be obtained by using authors’ artifacts (i.e., source code datasets) with same setup; (2) replicability result their re-implemented a different setup. We observed that commonly overlook these factors declare them as minor threats or leave for future work. mainly due to high model complexity manually set parameters time-consuming optimization process, unlike classical supervised machine (ML) methods (e.g., random forest). study aims investigate urgency importance of tasks. Method: In this study, we conducted literature review 147 recently published 20 venues AI (Artificial Intelligence) issues. also re-ran four representative important may strongly affect study. Results: Our statistics show investigating SE, where only 10.2% any research question address at least one issue and/or reproducibility.
