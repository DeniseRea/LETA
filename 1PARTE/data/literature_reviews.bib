  abstract = {An increasingly popular set of techniques adopted by software engineering (SE) researchers to automate development tasks are those rooted in the concept Deep Learning (DL). The popularity such largely stems from their automated feature capabilities, which aid modeling artifacts. However, due rapid pace at DL have been adopted, it is difficult distill current successes, failures, and opportunities research landscape. In an effort bring clarity this cross-cutting area work, its modern inception present, article presents a systematic literature review intersection SE \&amp; DL. canvasses work appearing most prominent conferences journals spans 128 papers across 23 unique tasks. We center our analysis around components learning , principles that governs application machine (ML) given problem domain, discussing several aspects surveyed granular level. end result roadmap both delineates foundations applied highlights likely areas fertile exploration for future.},

Deep has been increasingly used develop state-of-the-art software engineering (SE) research tools due boost performance for various SE tasks. There are many factors, e.g., selection, internal structure differences, optimization techniques, that may have impact on DNNs applied SE. Few works date focus summarizing, classifying, analyzing application techniques To fill this gap, we performed a survey analyze relevant studies published since 2006. We first provide example illustrate how then conduct background analysis (BA) primary present four questions describe trend (BA), summarize classify different (RQ1), data processing including collection, classification, pre-processing, representation (RQ2).
