ABSTRACT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recent years have seen the successful application of deep learning to software engineering (SE). In particular, development and use pre-trained models source code has enabled state-of-the-art results be achieved on a wide variety SE tasks. This paper provides an overview this rapidly advancing field research reflects future directions.
