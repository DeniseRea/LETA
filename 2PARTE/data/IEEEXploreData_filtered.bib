  year={2025},
  volume={13},
  pages={46070-46090},
  abstract={Software testing education is important for building qualified testing professionals. To ensure that software testing graduates are ready for real-world challenges, it is necessary to integrate modern tools and technologies into the curriculum. With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), their potential use in software engineering has become a focus, but their application in software testing education remains largely unexplored. This study, conducted in the Capstone Project course of a postgraduate software testing program, was carried out over two semesters with two distinct groups of students.},
